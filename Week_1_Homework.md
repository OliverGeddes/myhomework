### **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
* In terms of peformance and applicaiton ability, NestWealth is very similar relative to its competitors. NestWealth's main competitor is WealthSimple, who have a very similar product/service. The key difference here is that NestWealth has a different fee structure more appealing to larger investors. Smaller investors would likely go to other companies due to the lower costs with a lower portfolio.

## Recommendations
---
### **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Why?**

* NestWealth is targeted towards high net worth investors, mainly due to their fee structure, it is more cost effective for a smaller investor to do to a competitor. I would suggest altering the fee struture and benefits for smaller investors as this market are currently pushed towards competitors. This would then pull in younger investors who will have loyalty to NestWealth as they grow their portfolio to become high net worth.
